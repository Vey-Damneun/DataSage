<h2>📚 Business Analytics</h2>

Understanding the significance of privacy and data confidentiality, I cannot display actual projects due to their confidential nature. Instead, I'll share a range of projects, analyses, models, consultations, and recommendation reports, all using open-source data. The showcased MSBA project for the community involved a variety of tasks. This included producing detailed consultation reports, conducting regular updates and meetings, creating datasets, and developing a chatbot integrated with Facebook Messenger for real-time customer interaction. Moreover, I designed an interactive dashboard using Tableau and provided written recommendations to enhance company efficiency.

Throughout these projects, I utilized programming languages like R for analysis and IBM Watson for AI and machine learning tasks. Project management tools, such as Project for sprint tracking and Trello for team collaboration and project updates, were essential parts of my workflow. To gather large datasets for analysis, I leveraged Twitter for live data collection and surveyed numerous public databases. Regular monthly updates were presented to the team, and a final presentation was made to the community.

Your HTML code looks fine but if you want the paragraph to appear more aesthetic and prevent line chopping, you can adjust the width of the table. However, keep in mind that HTML rendering can greatly differ depending on the web browser and the display size, so it might still appear differently on other devices. Here's a possible solution using CSS to specify a fixed width and automatic word wrapping:

This CSS style helps ensure that the paragraph is displayed within a fixed width and lines are automatically wrapped to the next line if they are too long. You can adjust the width as needed.

It seems there's a misunderstanding here. The code you provided does not seem to contain any errors and should be functional HTML.

However, if you want each project to appear in a separate cell in the table, you need to use individual <td> tags for each project. I've made this correction below:

In the <tr> tag for the project list, I've separated each project into its own <td> tag, so each project appears in a separate cell. The colspan="3" attribute in the <td> tag for the description means that the text will span across three columns. If your table has more or fewer columns, you may need to adjust this number accordingly.
